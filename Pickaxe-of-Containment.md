The Pickaxe of Containment is an item in the [Tools](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) category.<br>
It is an Iron Pickaxe which allows you to pick up spawners. Although it can be enchanted like any other tool, it is not affected by the Fortune enchantment.

## Obtaining
The Pickaxe of Containment can be crafted at a [Magic Workbench](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magic-Workbench).

## Usage
Breaking a vanilla spawner with a Pickaxe of Containment will produce a [Broken Spawner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Broken-Spawner) with the same mob type as the original one. It can be [repaired](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Reinforced-Spawner) at an [Ancient Altar](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ancient-Altar).<br>
