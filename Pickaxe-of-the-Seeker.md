The Pickaxe of the Seeker is an item in the [tools](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) category.<br>
It is an unenchanted diamond pickaxe which can help you locate nearby ore.

## Obtaining
The Pickaxe of the Seeker can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
When you right-click with the pickaxe in your main hand, it forces you to look in the direction of the closest ore block in a 4 block radius.<br>
However, using this ability consumes durability, even if no ore is found nearby, so use it carefully.
