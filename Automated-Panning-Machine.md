The Automated Panning Machine is in the [Basic Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) category. It is a multiblock structure.<br>
It's an automated version of the [Gold Pan](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Pan) and the [Nether Gold Pan](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Gold-Pan).

## Obtaining
The Automated Panning Machine is a multiblock structure, it consists of a cauldron and a trapdoor. Trapdoor can be of any wood type.<br>

A complete setup should look like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the cauldron to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest), then it will be thrown on top of the trapdoor.

## Usage
It's a faster version of the [Gold Pan](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Pan) and the [Nether Gold Pan](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Gold-Pan) and has the exact same usages as them combined.<br>
To use the Automated Panning Machine, right click trapdoor with any block that is convertable, it will then proceed to output its converted items after a small animation.
