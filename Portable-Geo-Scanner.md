The Portable Geo-Scanner is a tool added in the [GPS](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS) category. It is a portable version of the [GPS Geo-Scanner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS-Geo-Scanner).

## Obtaining
The Portable Geo-Scanner can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
Right-Clicking with a Portable Geo-Scanner opens a chest GUI with the overview of mineable resources of the given chunk.

These resources are only obtainable using an [Oil Pump](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Oil-Pump) or a [GEO Miner](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GEO-Miner).

Scanning requires a [GPS network complexity](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS-Transmitter) of at least 600.
