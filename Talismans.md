Talismans are items which grant you special effects while in your possession. They can be crafted in a [Magic Workbench](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magic-Workbench).

Tier I Talismans only work while you carry them in your inventory, while Tier II (Ender) Talismans can work from inside your Ender Chest.<br>
Note that some Talismans will be consumed upon use.
