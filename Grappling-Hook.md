The Grappling Hook is a useful [tool](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) which provides great mobility, allowing you to access otherwise hard-to-reach places.

## Obtaining
The Grappling Hook can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
Right-clicking with a Grappling Hook in your main hand will shoot an arrow with a lead attached to it.<br>
Once the arrow hits a block or entity, it will quickly pull you towards it.<br>
The Grappling Hook will then be dropped as an item wherever the arrow landed, so it can be picked up and reused.

The arrow also deals 4 damage (2 hearts) to any living entity it hits, so it can be potentially weaponized.
