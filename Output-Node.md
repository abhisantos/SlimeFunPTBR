An Ouput Node is the component of a [cargo network](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) which receives items sent by an [input node](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Input-Node).<br>
An output node takes every available item sent through the selected channel. To filter specific items, use [advanced output nodes](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Advanced-Output-Node), which use a whitelist/blacklist system.

## Obtaining
Output nodes can be crafted in groups of two in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
An output node moves items from the network into the container or [machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) on which it is placed.<br>
It must be aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Manager) or a [connector](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Connector-Node) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals).

Right-clicking an input node displays an interface where you can choose the channel from which it receives items.
