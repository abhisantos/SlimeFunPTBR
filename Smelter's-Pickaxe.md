The Smelter's Pickaxe is a [Tool](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) added in Slimefun.

It is an unenchanted Diamond Pickaxe which automatically turns the ores it mines into the matching ingots, as if they were smelted in a furnace.<br>
It is compatible with the Fortune enchantment, to yield even more items.
