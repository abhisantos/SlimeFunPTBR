A Connector Node is the component of a [cargo network](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) which connects the different parts of the network.

## Obtaining
Connector nodes can be crafted in groups of four in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
A connector node must be aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Manager) or another connector in range of one, in a straight line (no diagonals).

Connector nodes extend the network's range by an additional 6 blocks. Any [input](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Input-Node) and [ouput nodes](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Node) in that range will be connected to the network.

By default, a connector emits red particles along its range when it is connected to a cargo manager. Right-clicking a connector node will display a message about its connection status.
