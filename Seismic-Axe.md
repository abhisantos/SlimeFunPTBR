The Seismic Axe is a [Weapon](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Weapons) added in Slimefun.<br>
It is an Iron Axe with a special ability: when used (right click), it visually launches up to 10x1 blocks up in the air in the direction the Player is looking at, and pushes any entity in its way 4 blocks away. However, this consumes 4 points of durability, so using this ability can deplete the item very quickly.
