Broken Spawners are an item in the [Magical Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) category.<br>
As the name implies, they do not function in this state.

## Obtaining
A Broken Spawner can be acquired by destroying a vanilla spawner with a [Pickaxe of Containment](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Pickaxe-of-Containment). The mob type will be the same as the original, working spawner.

## Usage
A Broken Spawner does not work and cannot be placed. However, it can be [repaired](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Reinforced-Spawner) by performing the correct ritual (found in your Slimefun guide) at an [Ancient Altar](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ancient-Altar).
