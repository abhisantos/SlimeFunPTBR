The Enhanced Crafting Table is an essential [Basic Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) in Slimefun.<br>
It is used to craft many Slimefun items, from the most basic to the most complex.

## How to build an Enhanced Crafting Table
The recipe can be found in your Slimefun Guide. To build it, you need to place a Crafting Table on top of a Dispenser.<br>
A complete Enhanced Crafting Table looks like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the Dispenser to collect your crafted items.

## How to use an Enhanced Crafting Table
Place your items in the correct pattern in the Dispenser, then right click the Crafting Table.<br>
If the recipe is correct, the crafted item will appear in the Dispenser (or the Output Chest next to it).
